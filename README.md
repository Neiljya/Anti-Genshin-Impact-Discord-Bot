# ANTI GENSHIN IMPACT DISCORD BOT

## Disclaimer
This is an extremely old project and one of my first projects, the project is structured very poorly and at the time I did not know about JSON. Furthermore
the code itself has many issues

## Features:
This bot has two main features, both of which triggers a flag or "mute role"
1. Detecting specific keywords (poorly made because it flags a message if it detects the phrase anywhere)
2. Detecting game activity (specifically Genshin Impact)

### Usage:
1. Enter your bot token in the 'TOKEN' variable
2. Create a designated "flagged" role in your server that has the restrictions you want
3. You can add the names of excluded roles if needed
4. Bot properties can be modified directly in 'config'
5. You can modify the filter words separated by a newline in 'config/filter.txt'
6. Nicknames and responses can be modified by adding in the desired nickname/response and then followed with ':'
